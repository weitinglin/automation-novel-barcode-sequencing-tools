# automation-novel-barcode-sequencing-tools
This repository provides R scripts, barcoding design tools, and automation prototypes for a Golden-Gate-aided within-read barcoding method that assembles multiple targeted fragments. It integrates protocol optimization and barcode analysis to multiplex over 100 strains per Nanopore run with reduced cost and high accuracy.
